# Go Worker Pool System

This is a lightweight and concurrent Worker Pool and Job Queue system written in Go. It supports multiple worker pools running concurrently, such as:

- âœ… **Email Dispatch Queue** â€“ sends emails asynchronously.
- ðŸ“„ **Log Processor Queue** â€“ processes and stores logs in the background.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Efficient use of goroutines and channels.
- Graceful shutdown of all workers.
- Modular job types (`EmailJob`, `LogJob`) via interfaces.
- Easy to extend (add retries, priorities, metrics).
